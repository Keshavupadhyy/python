"""
In Python, a tuple is a collection of ordered and immutable elements.
Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed,
"""
my_tuple = (1,2,3,4,5)
# print(my_tuple[1])
# print(5 in my_tuple)
# new_tuple = my_tuple[1:4]
# print(new_tuple)

#methods in tuple are only two

print(my_tuple.index(5))
print(my_tuple.count(5))
